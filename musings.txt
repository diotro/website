Elm comes with a fuzzer built into the unit test library? A language after my heart

I have no clue where to get started here - with basic HTML/JS/CSS you can get started mucking around with files immediately, but with elm I had to find create-elm-app

Note: Run this thing with `elm-app start`
Note: Test this thing with `elm-test`
