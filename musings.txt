Elm comes with a fuzzer built into the unit test library? A language after my heart

I have no clue where to get started here - with basic HTML/JS/CSS you can get started mucking around with files immediately, but with elm I had to find create-elm-app

Note: Run this thing with `elm-app start`
Note: Test this thing with `elm-test`

Elm seems to have a higher overhead than JavaScript, but I'm okay with that - Scala has a higher overhead than Java, but I think it's worth it. It is strange to feel like a novice to a programming language though, most languages are so similar I can pick it up with just a glance at the standard library. Here, messages, ports, DSLs for url parsing, sum types everywhere, all lead to a lot of confusion to get something simple working.

Is there a simple SPA (no, not the realworld one, that is bafflingly complex) that I can find? Let's hope

The Unix philosophy runs deep. My intuitions about directories applied to gcloud: why wasn't `gsutil rsync` syncing the folders in the `build/` directory? Not sure, so I tried the `-r` flag and it worked. Practicing computer science benefits a lot from knowing all this random trivia.
